You can assign a score to each input and output file.\nPrerequisites\nFormat: .txt files\nBulk upload format: .txt files zipped into individual .zip/.tar files\nNaming convention for input files: in00.txt|bin, in01.txt|bin, etc.\nNaming convention for output files: out00.txt|bin, out01.txt|bin, etc.\nUploading manual test cases\nTo upload manual test cases, follow these steps:\nClick Add test cases.\nA new modal of adding test case appears on the system.\nClick the checkbox beside Visible to candidates to make this test case visible to candidates.\nHover over Add input file text box and add the input in the field.\nNavigate to the location where the input file is stored in your system.\nDouble-click the file.\nHover over Add output file and add the output in the field.\nNavigate to the location where the output file is stored in your system.\nDouble-click the file.\nEnter the maximum score for this particular test case. For example, 20.\nYou can also add an explanation to this test case.\nClick Save.\nRepeat these steps for all the input and corresponding output files.\nUploading test cases in bulk\nTo upload test cases in bulk, follow these steps:\nImportant: The files should not be put in a folder and zipped. Zip individual .txt files.\nZip each set of input and output files by following these steps:\nNavigate to the location where the input and output files are saved.\nNote: These must follow the naming convention.\nClick an input file to select it and press Ctrl and click the corresponding output file to select it.\nRight-click on any of the selected files->Send to->Compressed (zipped folder).\nClick Upload zip/tar.\nNavigate to the location where the zipped files are stored.\nDouble-click the required file. The file is uploaded successfully if you have followed the right naming convention and formats.\nAssign the required score.\nNote: You can also edit the test cases after adding or uploading the file. They will open in the same format they were uploaded in. For example, if a test case was a manual test case, then the modal will be a manual test case modal. If the test case was a file upload, the modal will have a file upload option.\nCode checker settings\nThis setting defines the following:\nMaximum time duration (in sec) in which a candidate's code must be executed for individual test cases\nMaximum memory (in MB) that a candidate's code can utilize while being executed\nMaximum size (in KB) of code that can be submitted by a candidate\nTo set these settings, follow these steps:\nSet the Time limit (sec). For example, 5.\nSet the Memory limit (MB). For example, 256.\nSet the Maximum size of code. For example, 1024.\nLanguages\nAllowed languages\nSelect the programming languages in which candidates can write their code for a programming question.\nCheck the checkbox beside Select all to select all the 41 programming languages in which candidates can write their code.\nCode snippets\nA code snippet is a boilerplate code that can be used without changing it. This code helps such candidates who are not familiar with the online coding environment to focus more on the algorithm that is required to solve the question rather than understanding the STD INPUT and OUTPUT syntaxes.\nTo know more about how to generate code snippets in a question, click here.\nEditorial\nThis section contains a detailed approach to solve the question. It is mainly used for internal purposes such as testing the question, formatting the question, and so on.\nSteps\nTo add a sample explanation, follow these steps:\nIn the Editorial field, enter the logical explanation of how to solve the question.\nFormat as required\nNow, click Publish to add the question in the test. If you want to save the question as a draft for any future tasks, then click Save as draft.\nImportant: You can save your question as a draft at any time to save all the tasks that you have completed at that span of time. For example, if you have added the solution and test cases to the question but you want to select the allowed languages after some time, then click Save as draft. Your tasks or changes will not be lost and you can resume from where you left.","docId":18062222831,"fromSeedUrl":"https://help.hackerearth.com/","seedUrlHash32":1957119,"parentUrlDocId":67941115363,"gburl":"https://help.hackerearth.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005444233-creating-custom-programming-questions-diffbotxyz1166117617","lastCrawlTimeUTC":1719137946,"timestamp":"Sun, 23 Jun 2024 10:19:06 GMT"}

Recommendation: The first two Easy test cases should be made visible to candidates\nIf you have an array with size n equal to 10^5 constraints, then your n value should be less than equal to 10.\nProblem Constraint\nTest Case Constraint\nIf the total score of your question is 100, then your Easy test cases should have a score of 5 each\nExample\nTest Case 1: 5 Marks\nTest Case 2: 5 Marks\nThe constraint size should be minimal as possible\nThe brute force approach can be used to solve the test case\nA candidate should be able to solve this test case manually\nMedium test case\nMedium test cases should meet these conditions.\nFeatures of the test case\nExample\nScore\nAdd three Medium test cases\nIf you have an array with size n equal to 10^5 constraints, then your n value should be less than equal to 10^3\nProblem Constraint\nTest Case Constraint\nIf the total score of your question is 100, then your Medium test cases should have a score of 5 each\nExample\nTest Case 3: 5 Marks\nTest Case 4: 5 Marks\nTest Case 5: 5 Marks\nThese test cases should cover corner cases related to the algorithm being used\nA candidate should be able to solve these test cases in the most optimal manner.\nFor example, a Greedy Algorithmic approach can be used to solve the test case.\nHard test cases\nHard test cases should meet these conditions.\nFeatures of the test case\nExample\nScore\nAdd five Hard test cases\nIf you have an array with size n equal to 10^5 constraints, then your n value should be less than equal to 10^5.\nProblem Constraint\nTest Case Constraint\nIf the total score of your question is 100, then your Hard test cases should have a score of 15 each\nExample\nTest Case 6: 15 Marks\nTest Case 7: 15 Marks\nTest Case 8: 15 Marks\nTest Case 9: 15 Marks\nTest Case 10: 15 Marks\nThese test cases are aimed at checking if candidates can solve the problem in the most optimal manner\nThe constraint size should be as exhaustive as possible\nOnly the correct algorithm or approach can be used to solve the test case\nGenerating test cases\nGenerate test cases that are compatible with the auto-generated code snippets. For example, assume that you are creating test cases for this problem statement:\nWrite a program to find the highest/maximum number in an array.\nSample input and sample output\nThe input and output for this problem statement will be as follows:\nExplanation\nHere 10 in the first line of the sample input signifies the number of elements in the array\nThe second line of the sample input signifies 10 elements in the array, separated by spaces\nThe sample output only contains the answer that is the highest/maximum number in the array\nSo, go through the auto-generated code snippets first and then generate the test cases accordingly so that you don\u2019t have to change the auto-generated code snippets afterward.\nThis is how you can easily create test cases for programming questions for various difficulties.\nSolution for the example problem in C++\nCode to create random test cases in C++ in your local system","docId":75653998072,"fromSeedUrl":"https://help.hackerearth.com/","seedUrlHash32":1957119,"parentUrlDocId":61706905058,"gburl":"https://help.hackerearth.com/hc/en-us/articles/9810665517081-test-case-format-diffbotxyz399522626","lastCrawlTimeUTC":1719137889,"timestamp":"Sun, 23 Jun 2024 10:18:09 GMT"}

For example, in this instance, the platform auto-evaluates a full stack question on the basis of JUnit test cases. An equal score is assigned to each of the test cases. If a candidate passes all the test cases, they receive the total score assigned to the problem.\nHowever, if the code satisfies certain test cases but fails some test cases, the score obtained is proportional to the number of test cases the code fulfills.\nHackerEarth generates an XML file on runtime to evaluate the JUnit test cases.\nFor most frameworks, this can be enabled using the JEST Testing framework and Jest JUnit XML Reporter.\nThe specific libraries differ by the framework. However, any testing library which generates an XML Report is supported on HackerEarth.\nWriting test cases\nYou can write both backend and frontend test cases in the given format.\nFrontend test cases\nThe given sample code is a test script written in JavaScript using the Jest testing framework and the testing library as react library.\nimport React from 'react';\nimport '@testing-library/jest-dom';\nimport { render, screen, act, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';\nimport Login from './src/components/Login';\nimport Register from './src/components/Register';\nimport { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport io from 'socket.io-client';\ndescribe('Frontend Test', () => {\n  describe('Testing Socket IO', () => {\n    beforeEach(() => {\n      jest.resetModules();\n    });\n    it('Register component success', async () => {\n      jest.doMock('socket.io-client', () => {\n        const mSocket = {\n          emit: jest.fn(),\n          on: jest.fn(),\n        };\n        return jest.fn(() => mSocket);\n      });\n      const io = require('socket.io-client');\n      const ENDPOINT = 'localhost:8000';\n      const mockSocket = io(ENDPOINT);\n      render(\n        <BrowserRouter>\n          <Register socket={mockSocket} />\n        <\/BrowserRouter>\n      );\n      const usernameInp = screen.getByRole('textbox', { name: /username/i });\n      const passwordInp = screen.getByLabelText(/password/i);\n      const emailInp = screen.getByRole('textbox', { name: /email address/i });\n      const regBtn = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /register/i });\n      userEvent.type(usernameInp, 'test1');\n      userEvent.type(passwordInp, '123456');\n      userEvent.type(emailInp, 'test1@gmail.com');\n      userEvent.click(regBtn);\n      await waitFor(() => {\n        expect(mockSocket.emit).toBeCalledWith('register', {\n          email: 'test1@gmail.com',\n          password: '123456',\n          username: 'test1',\n        });\n      });\n    });\n  });\n});\n \nBackend test cases\nconst {registerUser, loginUser } = require(\"./src/SocketFunctions\");\ndescribe(\"Backend Test\", () => {\n  const user = {\n    username: \"test1\",\n    email: \"test1@hotmail.com\",\n    password: \"123456\",\n    images: [],\n  };\n  const loggedUser = {\n    _email: \"test1@hotmail.com\",\n  };\n  test(\"Register User Success\", async () => {\n    const response = registerUser(user);\n    expect(response).toMatchObject({ user });\n  });\n  test(\"Register User Failed\", async () => {\n    registerUser(user);\n    const response = registerUser(user);\n    expect(response).toMatchObject({ error: \"User already exists!\" });\n  });\n  test(\"Login User Success\", async () => {\n    registerUser(user);\n    const response = loginUser(user);\n    expect(response).toMatchObject({ user: loggedUser });\n  });\n});\nXML files examples\nThe standard format for an XML file is as follows:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<testsuites name=\"[Test suite name]\" tests=\"[Total number of tests]\" failures=\"[Number of failures]\" errors=\"[Number of errors]\" time=\"[Total execution time]\">\n <testsuite name=\"[Test suite file name]\" errors=\"[number of Errors]\" failures=\"[number of failures]\" skipped=\"[Number of skipped tests]\" timestamp=\"[Execution timestamp]\" time=\"[Test suite execution time]\" tests=\"[Total number of tests]\">\n   <testcase classname=\"[Test class/module name]\" name=\"[Test case name]\" time=\"[Test case execution time]\">\n   <\/testcase>\n   <!-- Add more <testcase> elements for additional test cases -->\n <\/testsuite>\n <!-- Add more <testsuite> elements for additional test suites -->\n<\/testsuites>\nYou can replace the placeholders within square brackets with the appropriate values for your specific test report.

Smart Browser provides you with various features that will help you to enable stricter proctoring settings in your assessments. When you select the Smart Browser setting, some of the settings are selected by default along with the addition of new ones. To learn more about Smart Browser, read <a href=\"https://help.hackerearth.com/advanced-proctoring-settings-smart-browser\">this article<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Random questions shuffling<\/h3>\n<p>You can enable random questions shuffling in the proctroing settings. This will change the order of the questions for each candidate when they start the assessment. This will make it difficult for candidates to use any unfair practices in the assessment.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Disable the Copy and Paste feature in the code editor<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>When this setting is enabled, a candidate cannot copy the code (for example, from the Web or a local computer) and paste it into the code editor.<\/p>\n<p>We recommend that you enable this setting if your test contains a question that requires the candidate to write code.<\/p>\n<p><em>Important<\/em>: By default, the candidates are not allowed to copy the problem statements in the test interface.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Take candidate snapshots during the test<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>When this option is enabled, candidates must give permission to enable the webcam on their computers. If they do not, they cannot take the test.<\/p>\n<p>When the test is live, we take a snapshot of the candidate at random intervals. A thumbnail preview of the webcam will be displayed on the bottom right of the screen, which indicates that the candidates are being monitored during the test.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>When should this option be enabled?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Enable this option for candidates who are taking the test remotely. Ensure that you inform them in advance that they need a webcam to be able to take the test.<\/p>\n<p>Do not enable this option in the following scenarios:<\/p>\n<ul> <li>If you know that the candidate does not have/have access to a webcam.<\/li> <li>For universities where the tests are taken in the Computer labs because most computers in the lab may not have a webcam.<\/li> <\/ul>\n<h3>ID verification<\/h3>\n<p>When this option is enabled, candidates must upload a government ID (Aadhar or PAN) along with an image captured before the assessment, which HackerEarth verifies to ensure that the candidate taking the assessment is the same as the one in the government ID. This makes your assessment more secure and provides better proctoring for candidates while taking the assessments.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Restrict candidate to the full-screen mode during the test<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>You can enable this to prevent candidates from cheating. When this is enabled, candidates can take the test in full-screen mode only. A warning is displayed on the screen if they exit full-screen mode during the test.<\/p>\n<h3>Disable submission results for candidates<\/h3>\n<p>You can enable this setting for the candidate if you do not want them to see their own submission results against programming test cases.

Smart Browser provides you with various features that will help you to enable stricter proctoring settings in your assessments. When you select the Smart Browser setting, some of the settings are selected by default along with the addition of new ones. To learn more about Smart Browser, read this article.\nRandom questions shuffling\nYou can enable random questions shuffling in the proctroing settings. This will change the order of the questions for each candidate when they start the assessment. This will make it difficult for candidates to use any unfair practices in the assessment.\nDisable the Copy and Paste feature in the code editor\nWhen this setting is enabled, a candidate cannot copy the code (for example, from the Web or a local computer) and paste it into the code editor.\nWe recommend that you enable this setting if your test contains a question that requires the candidate to write code.\nImportant: By default, the candidates are not allowed to copy the problem statements in the test interface.\nTake candidate snapshots during the test\nWhen this option is enabled, candidates must give permission to enable the webcam on their computers. If they do not, they cannot take the test.\nWhen the test is live, we take a snapshot of the candidate at random intervals. A thumbnail preview of the webcam will be displayed on the bottom right of the screen, which indicates that the candidates are being monitored during the test.\nWhen should this option be enabled?\nEnable this option for candidates who are taking the test remotely. Ensure that you inform them in advance that they need a webcam to be able to take the test.\nDo not enable this option in the following scenarios:\nIf you know that the candidate does not have/have access to a webcam.\nFor universities where the tests are taken in the Computer labs because most computers in the lab may not have a webcam.\nID verification\nWhen this option is enabled, candidates must upload a government ID (Aadhar or PAN) along with an image captured before the assessment, which HackerEarth verifies to ensure that the candidate taking the assessment is the same as the one in the government ID. This makes your assessment more secure and provides better proctoring for candidates while taking the assessments.\nRestrict candidate to the full-screen mode during the test\nYou can enable this to prevent candidates from cheating. When this is enabled, candidates can take the test in full-screen mode only. A warning is displayed on the screen if they exit full-screen mode during the test.\nDisable submission results for candidates\nYou can enable this setting for the candidate if you do not want them to see their own submission results against programming test cases. The candidate will still be able to see the results of their submission for visible test cases and custom input.\nLog out on leaving the test environment\nThis setting allows you to set the number of times a candidate can move out of the test environment. The ideal number of warnings is 5, which is set by default. You can change this if required.\nWhen this is enabled, the system gives the candidate a warning each time they move out of the test environment. The following actions include but are not limited to actions that are considered as \u2018moving out of the test environment\u2019:\nSwitching tabs\nSwitching windows\nOpening new applications on the computer including system popups like anti-virus notifications, Lync notifications, Skype notifications, etc.\nImportant: Moving out of the test environment to close notifications is also counted as leaving the test environment.\nRestrict test access for certain IP addresses\nIP addresses identify specific computers. Restricting IP addresses and subnets allows you to contain the test-taking to a single location. When these restrictions are enabled for a test and a candidate tries to log in from an IP that is outside the restricted range, a warning is displayed.\nUniversities use this to ensure that the test is taken only from their computer labs.

The evaluation metric in this case is a checker file. This file is used to evaluate a candidate's submission. A checker file contains the following two functions:\ngen_score: To generate the score after evaluation of the candidate\u2019s submission.\nverify_submission: To verify the file submitted by the candidate, you must perform some checks. Some of these checkpoints include checking the file type, number of rows present, number of columns present, predictions for all IDs provided in result.format, and so on.\nProgramming languages supported\nHackerEarth uses Python 3 to create checker files.\nStructure of a checker file\nImporting libraries\nYou must import all the required libraries. Refer to the following image for a list of the required libraries.\nLoading the result and submission file path\nThe parts of this code and its description are as follows:\nA default JSON file is loaded to the data variable from HackerEarth\u2019s platform. This file contains the path of the test case and user submission.\nThe testcase variable is assigned the path for the test case file.\nThe user_submission variable is assigned the path of the candidate\u2019s submission file.\nThe gen_score() function\nThis function takes two arguments \u2015 actual and predicted. The actual parameter represents the truth values of the target column(s) in the test case and the predicted parameter represents the predictions of the target column(s) in a candidate's submission file. Here, the score variable contains the formula based on the evaluation metric.\nThe gen_score function with two parameters as mentioned.\nThe score is calculated based on an evaluation metric and is assigned to the score variable.\nThe function returns the value of the score after the required calculation in the previous step.\nExample\nThe evaluation metrics are mostly imported from the scikit-learn library. The example is as follows;\nAs mean_squared_error is an error-defining metric, the lower the error the better the model is.\nWe always assume the highest score to be 100 so we subtract the error from 100. The max function is used to normalize the score to range between 0 to 100.\nThe verify_submission() function\n1. The ID variable represents the name of the index or ID column. You are required to enter the name of the index or ID column in place of None.\nExample\n2. The following line of code checks the type of the submission file submitted by the candidate such as whether it is in .csv format:\nIf the file is not in .csv format, then the checker raises an exception and displays the following error message:\n3. The fp_submission variable (labeled as 1) reads the candidate's submission and the fp_testcase variable (labeled as 2) reads the test cases of the question.\n4. The following line of code assigns the number of rows of the result file to the num_rows variable.\nThe following line of code checks whether the number of rows of the submission file is equal to the number of rows of the test case:\nIf the number of rows is not equal, then the program raises an exception and displays the following error message:\n5. The candidate's submission must contain the following:\nAll the columns that are provided in the sample submission file.\nAll column names must be written in the same way as mentioned in the sample submission file.\nTo check if the set difference between the submission file\u2019s columns and the result file\u2019s columns must be equal to zero, the following line of code is performed:\nIn any case, if the submission file does not contain a column that is provided in the test case, then it raises an exception and the following error message is displayed:\n6. The following two lines of code set the index in the result file (labeled as 1) and candidate\u2019s submission (labeled as 2):\n7. The label_cols variable extracts the names (labels) of the columns that are available in the result file and the candidate's submission.\n8. You are required to determine all unique IDs that are available in the result file and the candidate's submission. All the common index values or unique IDs are stored in this variable.\n9. A candidate can miss certain index values or unique IDs. You are required to check the unique IDs that are available in test cases but are not available in the candidate's submission. This is performed by using the following code of line:\nHere, the not_in_test variable stores the indexes that are missing in the candidate\u2019s submission file.\nFurther, if the length of not_in_test is equal to 0, that is, there are no missing index values, then the submission is accepted.\nIf there are missing index values, then these values are stored in the following key_not_found variable.\nAll the missing index values are displayed in the following error message:\n10. The following two lines of code allow you to select the predictions across the index values that are common between the result file (labeled as 1) and the candidate\u2019s submission file (labeled as 2).\n11. The required predictions for all the unique IDs in the result file and the candidate's submission are initialized in the actual_values (labeled as 1) and predicted_values (labeled as 2) variables, respectively.\nThen, the actual values and predicted values are passed in the gen_score function. This is shown in the following line of code:\n12. The gen_score returns the score and it is printed up to six decimal places.\n13. The program begins with the verify_submission function (labeled as 1). If an exception is raised based on the checkpoints provided in the verify_submission function, it is displayed to the candidate (labeled as 2). This is performed by using the following lines of code:\nOnce you have understood the structure of a checker file, you can easily create your own with reference to the sample checker file. These are some important points to remember which are as follows:\nEnter the correct formula to generate the score of candidates.\nEnter the correct name of the column ID in the ID variable of the verify_submission function.","docId":242775369203,"fromSeedUrl":"https://help.hackerearth.com/","seedUrlHash32":1957119,"parentUrlDocId":171598865877,"gburl":"https://help.hackerearth.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005034803-checker-files-diffbotxyz840256240","lastCrawlTimeUTC":1719137839,"timestamp":"Sun, 23 Jun 2024 10:17:19 GMT"}

Therefore, HackerEarth Live Interview now supports the feature of recording the audio and video of interviews.\nThe advantages of this feature are as follows:\nOne of the primary benefits of recording an interview (audio or video) is that it allows the interviewer to concentrate on the interview rather than writing notes, which can act as a distraction to both the interviewee and the person(s) asking the questions.\nRecorded interviews allow the candidates and interviewers to develop and foster a better relationship and rapport during the interview that led to the candidate providing more detailed and in-depth information.\nIn addition to fostering a more positive, interactive, and informative discussion during the interview, audio and video recording also improve the quality and transparency of the provided information.\nIt also offers the advantage of providing feedback about the interviewers' techniques and ensuring more informative and productive interviews in the future.\nSteps\nTo record the audio and video of your scheduled interviews, follow these steps:\nLog in to your HackerEarth Assessment account by using the admin credentials.\nClick FaceCode.\nNow, schedule a new interview or go to the Ongoing interviews section. To know more about how to schedule new interviews, click here.\nClick the name of the interview.\nAs soon as you are redirected to the Interview interface, the Share your screen dialog box appears on the screen asking permission to share your entire screen, application window, or Chrome tab.\nSelect the displayed window in the box and click Share.\nYou have successfully started the recording of the interview. To stop the sharing of your screen, click Stop sharing which is available at the bottom of your screen.\nIf you click Cancel, then the video screen recording of the interview does not occur. However, the audio of the interview and the members' physical environment are recorded from the webcam.","docId":49159726590,"fromSeedUrl":"https://help.hackerearth.com/","seedUrlHash32":1957119,"parentUrlDocId":100621428175,"gburl":"https://help.hackerearth.com/hc/en-us/articles/900003061626-audio-and-video-recording-of-interviews-diffbotxyz1836575583","lastCrawlTimeUTC":1719137717,"timestamp":"Sun, 23 Jun 2024 10:15:17 GMT"}
