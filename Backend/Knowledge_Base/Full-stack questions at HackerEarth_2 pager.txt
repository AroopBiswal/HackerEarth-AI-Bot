FUL L- STACK Q U ESTI O N T YP E- DATASH EE T

What does a Full-Stack developer do?

A full-stack developer is a highly skilled programmer
knowledgeable in both the front-end and back-end of
an application. They are experienced generalists with
end-to-end knowledge of the technology stack used
to build an application and manage databases. These
days, it’s critical to have a full-stack developer in any
development team, and companies understand this.
While hiring for a full-stack role, it’s pertinent to look
for the skill set to straddle both front-end and
back-end.
Front-end refers to everything a user can see
and interact with when they open a website or
application. Front-end developers use
programming languages such as HTML, CSS,
and Javascript.
Back-end, on the other hand, refers to the
software code that communicates with the
servers, databases, and internal architecture.
Developers in this space possess skills such as
Python, PHP, Ruby on Rails, SQL and so on.
How does HackerEarth help in hiring
Full-Stack developers?

Full-stack questions on HackerEarth help in assessing
the front-end and back-end skills of the candidates.
These questions are mini-projects built with the
candidates’ time constraints in mind.
Therefore, candidates only need to create the
functionality of an application and not the entire
application.
Easy questions- 30 mins

Medium questions- 90 mins

Hard questions- 240 mins

Reading reports

HackerEarth auto-generates candidate reports at the
end of an assessment. These reports give insights into
the skill-wise performance of the candidates, report
any malpractice, and provide a detailed analysis of
their submission. Admins can also preview the
submission, download it, and also view the details of
unit test cases that passed in the evaluation.
Moreover, the reports can easily be shared with any
evaluator via a link.
