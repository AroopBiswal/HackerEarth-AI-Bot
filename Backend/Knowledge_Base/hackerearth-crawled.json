This code helps such candidates who are not familiar with the online coding environment to focus more on the algorithm that is required to solve the question rather than understanding the STD INPUT and OUTPUT syntaxes.\n\nTo know more about how to generate code snippets in a question, click [here](https://help.hackerearth.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002884553-code-snippets).\n\nEditorial\n\nThis section contains a detailed approach to solve the question. It is mainly used for internal purposes such as testing the question, formatting the question, and so on.\n\n**Steps**\n\nTo add a sample explanation, follow these steps:\n\n1.  In the **Editorial** field, enter the logical explanation of how to solve the question. \n2.  Format as required\n\nNow, click **Publish** to add the question in the test. If you want to save the question as a draft for any future tasks, then click **Save as draft**.\n\n**Important**: You can save your question as a draft at any time to save all the tasks that you have completed at that span of time. For example, if you have added the solution and test cases to the question but you want to select the allowed languages after some time, then click Save as draft. Your tasks or changes will not be lost and you can resume from where you left.",

Recommendation: The first two Easy test cases should be made visible to candidates | If you have an array with size n equal to 10^5 constraints, then your n value should be less than equal to 10.<br><br>**Problem Constraint**<br><br>![](https://help.hackerearth.com/hs-fs/hubfs/undefined-2.png?width=97&height=19&name=undefined-2.png)<br><br>**Test Case Constraint**<br><br>![](https://help.hackerearth.com/hs-fs/hubfs/undefined-3.png?width=91&height=16&name=undefined-3.png) | If the total score of your question is 100, then your Easy test cases should have a score of 5 each<br><br>**Example**<br><br>*   Test Case 1: 5 Marks<br>*   Test Case 2: 5 Marks |\n| The constraint size should be minimal as possible |\n| The brute force approach can be used to solve the test case |\n| A candidate should be able to solve this test case manually |\n\n#### Medium test case\n\nMedium test cases should meet these conditions.\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Features of the test case** | **Example** | **Score** |\n| Add three Medium test cases | If you have an array with size n equal to 10^5 constraints, then your n value should be less than equal to 10^3<br><br>**Problem Constraint**<br><br>![](https://help.hackerearth.com/hs-fs/hubfs/undefined-Jun-01-2023-10-49-20-5703-AM.png?width=97&height=19&name=undefined-Jun-01-2023-10-49-20-5703-AM.png)<br><br>**Test Case Constraint**<br><br>![](https://help.hackerearth.com/hs-fs/hubfs/undefined-4.png?width=97&height=19&name=undefined-4.png) | If the total score of your question is 100, then your Medium test cases should have a score of 5 each<br><br>**Example**<br><br>*   Test Case 3: 5 Marks<br>*   Test Case 4: 5 Marks<br>*   Test Case 5: 5 Marks |\n| These test cases should cover corner cases related to the algorithm being used |\n| A candidate should be able to solve these test cases in the most optimal manner.<br><br>For example, a Greedy Algorithmic approach can be used to solve the test case. |\n\n#### Hard test cases\n\nHard test cases should meet these conditions.\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Features of the test case** | **Example** | **Score** |\n| Add five Hard test cases | If you have an array with size n equal to 10^5 constraints, then your n value should be less than equal to 10^5.<br><br>**Problem Constraint**<br><br>![](https://help.hackerearth.com/hs-fs/hubfs/undefined-Jun-01-2023-10-50-17-1765-AM.png?width=97&height=19&name=undefined-Jun-01-2023-10-50-17-1765-AM.png)<br><br>**Test Case Constraint**<br><br>![](https://help.hackerearth.com/hs-fs/hubfs/undefined-Jun-01-2023-10-50-17-1765-AM.png?width=97&height=19&name=undefined-Jun-01-2023-10-50-17-1765-AM.png) | If the total score of your question is 100, then your Hard test cases should have a score of 15 each<br><br>**Example**<br><br>*   Test Case 6: 15 Marks<br>*   Test Case 7: 15 Marks<br>*   Test Case 8: 15 Marks<br>*   Test Case 9: 15 Marks<br>*   Test Case 10: 15 Marks |\n| These test cases are aimed at checking if candidates can solve the problem in the most optimal manner |\n| The constraint size should be as exhaustive as possible |\n| Only the correct algorithm or approach can be used to solve the test case |\n\n### Generating test cases\n\nGenerate test cases that are compatible with the [auto-generated code snippets](https://help.hackerearth.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002884553-code-snippets). For example, assume that you are creating test cases for this problem statement: \n\n**Write a program to find the highest/maximum number in an array.**\n\n#### Sample input and sample output\n\nThe input and output for this problem statement will be as follows:\n\n![](https://help.hackerearth.com/hs-fs/hubfs/undefined-Jun-01-2023-10-51-17-8549-AM.png?width=416&height=343&name=undefined-Jun-01-2023-10-51-17-8549-AM.png)\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   Here 10 in the first line of the sample input signifies the number of elements in the array\n*   The second line of the sample input signifies 10 elements in the array, separated by spaces\n*   The sample output only contains the answer that is the highest/maximum number in the array\n\nSo, go through the auto-generated code snippets first and then generate the test cases accordingly so that you don’t have to change the auto-generated code snippets afterward.\n\nThis is how you can easily create test cases for programming questions for various difficulties.\n\n#### Solution for the example problem in C++\n\n![](https://help.hackerearth.com/hs-fs/hubfs/undefined-Jun-01-2023-10-51-18-1203-AM.png?width=375&height=555&name=undefined-Jun-01-2023-10-51-18-1203-AM.png)\n\n### Code to create random test cases in C++ in your local system\n\n![](https://help.hackerearth.com/hs-fs/hubfs/undefined-Jun-01-2023-10-51-17-9798-AM.png?width=624&height=547&name=undefined-Jun-01-2023-10-51-17-9798-AM.png)",

This is a virtual machine spawned specifically for the particular question and all changes made to it will stay in this image.\n2. Install all the infrastructure dependencies that the question project needs, through the command-line interface. These could be programming languages, frontend/backend frameworks, or databases required for the question. The installation works similarly to how it would in a Linux environment. \n3. Add the names of the front-end and back-end frameworks that you have set up. There is no technical dependency but this will make it easier to identify them in the candidate assessment reports. \n4. Upload the question project with all the folders and files. There is no limitation on the folder structure or file naming as long as you map and mention them properly. You can refer to our full-stack boilerplate templates here to get started.\nNotes\nDo not use the given boilerplate templates as it is in an actual test environment. It is intended to serve as a sample project in order to help you get started.\nMake sure that the project folder is less than 5 MB in size.\nAll the files or folders (if any) that are not a part of the backend and frontend must be put inside the root folder.\nThere should only be a single root folder (example: src).\n\nFolder structure\nTo explain subsequent steps, We will be using a sample project with react as the front end and spring-boot as the back end. Open the project in GitHub or on your local machine to browse through the folder structure and files in detail.\nLink to the React-Spring sample project: Project\n5. Once the project is uploaded, You can directly view, edit and make changes to the uploaded files from the interface if needed. Don’t forget to Save Project after making any changes to the project.\nWe recommend keeping the frontend and backend files in separate master folders as shown below for ease of access and readability.\n6. Scroll down to the Settings and configuration section below the project editor. This section is for entering build, deploy, and evaluation commands for the frontend and backend. You will have to go through the below steps separately for the frontend and backend. Make sure you correctly enter and verify these commands.\nNote: Only Port 5000 and Port 8000 are available for frontend and backend respectively, please make sure that the port numbers are the same in your files and commands throughout the project.\nMake settings in Settings and configurations\n1. In the Project source field, select the source folder for all frontend/backend files.\nFor our sample project, \nThe source folder is named frontend for the frontend.\nThe source folder is named backend for the backend.\n2. In the Build commands field, enter the build commands required to build the project. In case of multiple commands, Click Add command to add another line of command. \nFor our sample project, \nThe build command for the frontend is npm install and npm run build which will auto-download and build all the dependencies mentioned in the package.json file located in the frontend folder. \nSimilarly, the build command for the backend is mvn build.\nBe cognizant of how the build commands work and which files they pick dependencies from in case of the framework of your choosing.\n3. In the Deploy commands field, enter the commands required to deploy the project in the production server. \nFor our sample project,\nThe deploy command for the frontend is “npm start”, which will execute all the node.js commands listed under the hackerearth-fs-spring-react-sample\\frontend\\package.json file's scripts>start section.\nThe deploy command for the backend is mvn spring-boot:run\n4. In the Sample Evaluation commands field, enter the commands required to evaluate the project based on the sample test cases.\nFor our sample project, \nThe sample evaluation command for the frontend is “npm run sample_tests”, which will evaluate the test cases present in the hackerearth-fs-spring-react-sample\\frontend\\sample.test.js file.\nThe sample evaluation command for the backend is “mvn test -Dtest=com.hackerearth.backend.sample.*Tests ”, which will evaluate the test cases present in the hackerearth-fs-spring-react-sample\\backend\\src\\test\\java\\com\\hackerearth\\fullstack\\backend\\sample\\sampletests file.\n5. In the Evaluation commands field, enter the commands required to evaluate the project based on the main test cases (ensure that these cases are hidden - refer to the notes below).\nFor our sample project, \nThe sample evaluation command for the frontend is “npm run main_tests”, which will evaluate the test cases present in the hackerearth-fs-spring-react-sample\\frontend\\main.test.js file.\nThe evaluation command for the backend is “mvn test -Dtest=com.hackerearth.backend.main.*Tests ”, which will evaluate the test cases present in the hackerearth-fs-spring-react-sample\\backend\\src\\test\\java\\com\\hackerearth\\fullstack\\backend\\main\\BackendApplicationTests file. \nNotes\nEnsure folder/files containing maint test cases are marked as hidden while creating the question to prevent the candidate from viewing them.\nTo hide a file or a folder, go to the project editor, right-click on the file/folder containing main test cases and select “Hide” from the menu. Refer to the below image.\n6. In the Evaluation report path field, Enter the path where the evaluation report of this project is stored. The file is parsed as per junit and xunit formats and hence the output file can be in either format. Ensure that this file is in xml format.\nFor our sample project, \nIn case of the frontend, The package.json file contains junit as a dev dependency and also all the junit-related configurations. Note that the “outputDirectory” and “outputName” parameter is consistent with the Evaluation Report path field in the UI.\n7.

You can refer to this guide for detailed steps involving installation.\nMake sure that you create/modify user, password and other connection attributes that will be required by nodjs driver to connect to MongoDB.\nCheck if your project has a package.json file, if not set up NPM for your project by running the following command “npm init -y”. This command creates the package.json file.\nNext, add the official Node.js MongoDB driver to your project dependencies. Use the following command “npm install mongodb” to instruct NPM to download and install the mongodb package. This command downloads the mongodb package and dependencies required for its installation and saves them into a directory called node_modules in your project directory, and records the dependency information in the package.json file you generated in the previous step.\nNode.js can now use this module to manipulate MongoDB databases. Additional details can be found here.\nHow do I set up MySQL with spring-boot?\nInstall the MySQL database through the terminal.\nSetup the MYSQL, To do this, run the below commands inside the terminal and open the MySQL console.\nmysqld --user=root &\nmysql -uroot -p\nIt will prompt for password enter: mypassword\nNow enter the below SQL queries in the MySQL console.\ncreate database main_db;\nexit\nSetup the database as per the question requirements i.e create tables, data, etc.\nAdd a dependency for the MySQL connector to your maven POM.xml file. You can generate the relevant snippets here.\nUpdate the application.properties file in your source folder to configure the connection to the database.\nRefer to this guide for more details or refer to this article.",

  "text": "Full stack: Writing test cases and evaluation\nHackerEarth allows you to write Full stack test cases using any framework. For example, in this instance, the platform auto-evaluates a full stack question on the basis of JUnit test cases. An equal score is assigned to each of the test cases. If a candidate passes all the test cases, they receive the total score assigned to the problem. \nHowever, if the code satisfies certain test cases but fails some test cases, the score obtained is proportional to the number of test cases the code fulfills. \nHackerEarth generates an XML file on runtime to evaluate the JUnit test cases.\nFor most frameworks, this can be enabled using the JEST Testing framework and Jest JUnit XML Reporter. \nThe specific libraries differ by the framework. However, any testing library which generates an XML Report is supported on HackerEarth.\nWriting test cases\nYou can write both backend and frontend test cases in the given format.\nFrontend test cases\nThe given sample code is a test script written in JavaScript using the Jest testing framework and the testing library as react library.\nimport React from 'react';\nimport '@testing-library/jest-dom';\nimport { render, screen, act, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';\nimport Login from './src/components/Login';\nimport Register from './src/components/Register';\nimport { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport io from 'socket.io-client';\ndescribe('Frontend Test', () => {\ndescribe('Testing Socket IO', () => {\nbeforeEach(() => {\njest.resetModules();\n});\nit('Register component success', async () => {\njest.doMock('socket.io-client', () => {\nconst mSocket = {\nemit: jest.fn(),\non: jest.fn(),\n};\nreturn jest.fn(() => mSocket);\n});\nconst io = require('socket.io-client');\nconst ENDPOINT = 'localhost:8000';\nconst mockSocket = io(ENDPOINT);\nrender(\n<BrowserRouter>\n<Register socket={mockSocket} />\n</BrowserRouter>\n);\nconst usernameInp = screen.getByRole('textbox', { name: /username/i });\nconst passwordInp = screen.getByLabelText(/password/i);\nconst emailInp = screen.getByRole('textbox', { name: /email address/i });\nconst regBtn = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /register/i });\nuserEvent.type(usernameInp, 'test1');\nuserEvent.type(passwordInp, '123456');\nuserEvent.type(emailInp, 'test1@gmail.com');\nuserEvent.click(regBtn);\nawait waitFor(() => {\nexpect(mockSocket.emit).toBeCalledWith('register', {\nemail: 'test1@gmail.com',\npassword: '123456',\nusername: 'test1',\n});\n});\n});\n});\n});\nBackend test cases\nconst {registerUser, loginUser } = require(\"./src/SocketFunctions\");\ndescribe(\"Backend Test\", () => {\nconst user = {\nusername: \"test1\",\nemail: \"test1@hotmail.com\",\npassword: \"123456\",\nimages: [],\n};\nconst loggedUser = {\n_email: \"test1@hotmail.com\",\n};\ntest(\"Register User Success\", async () => {\nconst response = registerUser(user);\nexpect(response).toMatchObject({ user });\n});\ntest(\"Register User Failed\", async () => {\nregisterUser(user);\nconst response = registerUser(user);\nexpect(response).toMatchObject({ error: \"User already exists!\" });\n});\ntest(\"Login User Success\", async () => {\nregisterUser(user);\nconst response = loginUser(user);\nexpect(response).toMatchObject({ user: loggedUser });\n});\n});\nXML files examples\nThe standard format for an XML file is as follows:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<testsuites name=\"[Test suite name]\" tests=\"[Total number of tests]\" failures=\"[Number of failures]\" errors=\"[Number of errors]\" time=\"[Total execution time]\">\n<testsuite name=\"[Test suite file name]\" errors=\"[number of Errors]\" failures=\"[number of failures]\" skipped=\"[Number of skipped tests]\" timestamp=\"[Execution timestamp]\" time=\"[Test suite execution time]\" tests=\"[Total number of tests]\">\n<testcase classname=\"[Test class/module name]\" name=\"[Test case name]\" time=\"[Test case execution time]\">\n</testcase>\n<!-- Add more <testcase> elements for additional test cases -->\n</testsuite>\n<!-- Add more <testsuite> elements for additional test suites -->\n</testsuites>\nYou can replace the placeholders within square brackets with the appropriate values for your specific test report.

HackerEarth assigns the score equally to the backend and frontend test cases for a full stack question. For example, if a full stack question has 2 frontend test cases and 8 backend test cases and a candidate is able to pass all the frontend test cases but partially passes the backend test cases, they will be assigned the score accordingly. If a question is allocated 100 marks and the candidate passes 2 frontend test cases, they will receive 50 marks for the frontend test case, and the rest 50 marks will be divided into the 8 backend test cases. If the candidate passes 4 of them, they will receive 25 marks out of 50 and the total score they will receive for the whole question will be 75 out of 100.\nThis is how a typical full stack question is evaluated on the HackerEarth platform. Different frameworks require different test cases and the given example is just an example of a sample project.

  "text": "Creating a custom SQL question\nCreating a custom SQL question\n1. Log in to HackerEarth Assessment using admin credentials\n2. Click Library.\n3. Select My library and choose SQL under Question types.\n\n4. Click Add sql question. \nCreating a Problem Statement\nThe question-creation template is displayed on your screen with the following fields:\nProblem Name\nProblem Statement\nDifficulty level\n\n5. Add the name of your question in the Problem Name field.\n6. In the Problem Statement field, enter the problem statement that you want the candidate to solve. A good problem statement has the following:\nDescription: This part describes the problem that the candidate must solve. This part also describes what the issues are and what is required of the candidate to solve the problem. \nTable description: This part contains all the relationship details and sample data. For example, if there are two tables and one of them has some relationship with the other table regarding joins or foreign keys, then all the relevant information is to be stated in this section.\n7. Set the complexity of your question from the Difficulty level list.\n8. Click Save SQL Question. \nThe existing SQL template will be loaded with the following additional fields to enable you to create a question:\nEditorial\nSample explanation\nAllowed Databases\nSchema creation scripts\nSample Testcase \nTestcase Files\nEdit checker limits\nAnswer\nTags\nCode Snippets\nWriting an editorial and sample explanation\n9. In the Editorial field, describe one or more ideal approaches that a candidate can take while solving this problem. The editorial will be displayed only after the test ends.\n10. In the Sample Explanation field, give an example or describe relevant use cases for a candidate’s reference. This will guide them in selecting the right approach required to solve the problem.\nSetting up databases and creating schemas\n11. You can use the same schema file (SQL file) for all supported databases instead of uploading them individually by clicking Use single scheme script for all allowed databases \nNotes\nAll the required constraints must be added to this .sql file only. For example, refer to the sample schema in this sample .sql file.\nSample schema\nAdding sample test cases\n12. You can add a sample test case manually by entering the table name and uploading the test case. Enter the data in Sample test case to upload the test cases that will be used to set up a test database for a candidate. When the candidate clicks Execute & Run, the queries are executed in this database. These test cases are not scored.\nYou have two types of test cases:\nInput test cases \nOutput test cases\n\n1. Input test cases\nImportant: The data in input data files must be pipe-separated (‘|’) as shown in the following image. The data must also not contain any column names.\nSample input test case\nUpload the input test cases in the Input section by following these steps:\nClick Upload File.\nNavigate to the folder where the file is saved.\nSelect the .txt file.\nClick Open.\n2. Output section\nImportant: The data in output data files must be space-separated as shown in the following image. The data must also not contain any column names.\nUpload the output test cases in the Output section by following these steps:\nClick Upload File.\nNavigate to the folder where the file is saved.\nSelect the .txt file.\nClick Open.\nThis is how you can easily add sample test cases.\nAdding actual test case files\nA similar procedure can be performed for adding the Actual test case files. These test cases are the hidden test cases that get evaluated based on the candidate’s submission. \n13. Click +Add Test case and follow the similar steps used to add sample test cases. \nMaking checker settings\n16. In Edit checker limits, you are required to set the following parameters:\nTime Limit is the maximum time duration (in seconds) in which a candidate's code must be executed for individual test cases. The maximum time limit that can be set is 10 seconds.\nMax Code Size is the maximum size (in KB) of code that can be submitted by a candidate.\nMemory limit is the maximum memory (in MB) that a candidate's code can utilize while being executed.\nMax Tables is the maximum number of tables. This value is set to 10 tables by default. However, it can be changed based on your requirements.\nMax Rows per Table is the maximum number of rows in a table. This value is set to 30 rows by default. However, it can be changed based on your requirements. \nNote: If the table contains 100 rows then max rows per table must be any number that is greater than or equal to 101.\nAdding the answer\n17. You can add your solution to the problem in the Answer section. For example, you want the candidate to write a query to print the count of the unique number of engineers having a ‘software’ job from the table employee. In the Answer section, you must write the correct solution or query to solve the problem that will be \nselect count(engineers) from employees where engineers = ‘software’. \nAdding tags\nTags are important because they allow you to segregate different question types in your library. This makes it easier to search for the type of question you are searching for. For SQL questions you have the following four tags that can be used:\nSQL\nMS SQL\nPostgresql\nOracle\n18. Add Tags in the field provided\nSaving the question\n19. Click Save question once all the requirements have been completed.\nYou can also watch this video to learn how to create a custom SQL question.",

  "text": "Checker files\nPurpose\nEvery Data Science and Machine Learning question is conceptually different, therefore each question requires a unique evaluation metric. The evaluation metric in this case is a checker file. This file is used to evaluate a candidate's submission. A checker file contains the following two functions: \ngen_score: To generate the score after evaluation of the candidate’s submission.\nverify_submission: To verify the file submitted by the candidate, you must perform some checks. Some of these checkpoints include checking the file type, number of rows present, number of columns present, predictions for all IDs provided in result.format, and so on.\nProgramming languages supported\nHackerEarth uses Python 3 to create checker files.\nStructure of a checker file\nImporting libraries\nYou must import all the required libraries. Refer to the following image for a list of the required libraries. \nLoading the result and submission file path\nThe parts of this code and its description are as follows:\nA default JSON file is loaded to the data variable from HackerEarth’s platform. This file contains the path of the test case and user submission.\nThe testcase variable is assigned the path for the test case file.\nThe user_submission variable is assigned the path of the candidate’s submission file.\nThe gen_score() function\nThis function takes two arguments ― actual and predicted. The actual parameter represents the truth values of the target column(s) in the test case and the predicted parameter represents the predictions of the target column(s) in a candidate's submission file. Here, the score variable contains the formula based on the evaluation metric. \nHere, the descriptions of the labels are as follows:\nThe gen_score function with two parameters as mentioned.\nThe score is calculated based on an evaluation metric and is assigned to the score variable.\nThe function returns the value of the score after the required calculation in the previous step.\nExample \nThe evaluation metrics are mostly imported from the scikit-learn library. The example is as follows;\nAs mean_squared_error is an error-defining metric, the lower the error the better the model is.\nWe always assume the highest score to be 100 so we subtract the error from 100. The max function is used to normalize the score to range between 0 to 100.\nThe verify_submission() function\n1. The ID variable represents the name of the index or ID column. You are required to enter the name of the index or ID column in place of None.\nExample\n2. The following line of code checks the type of the submission file submitted by the candidate such as whether it is in .csv format: \nIf the file is not in .csv format, then the checker raises an exception and displays the following error message:\n3. The fp_submission variable (labeled as 1) reads the candidate's submission and the fp_testcase variable (labeled as 2) reads the test cases of the question.\n4. The following line of code assigns the number of rows of the result file to the num_rows variable. \nThe following line of code checks whether the number of rows of the submission file is equal to the number of rows of the test case:\n\nIf the number of rows is not equal, then the program raises an exception and displays the following error message:\n5. The candidate's submission must contain the following:\nAll the columns that are provided in the sample submission file.\nAll column names must be written in the same way as mentioned in the sample submission file. \nTo check if the set difference between the submission file’s columns and the result file’s columns must be equal to zero, the following line of code is performed:\nIn any case, if the submission file does not contain a column that is provided in the test case, then it raises an exception and the following error message is displayed:\n6. The following two lines of code set the index in the result file (labeled as 1) and candidate’s submission (labeled as 2):\n7. The label_cols variable extracts the names (labels) of the columns that are available in the result file and the candidate's submission. \n8. You are required to determine all unique IDs that are available in the result file and the candidate's submission. All the common index values or unique IDs are stored in this variable.\n9. A candidate can miss certain index values or unique IDs. You are required to check the unique IDs that are available in test cases but are not available in the candidate's submission. This is performed by using the following code of line:\nHere, the not_in_test variable stores the indexes that are missing in the candidate’s submission file.\nFurther, if the length of not_in_test is equal to 0, that is, there are no missing index values, then the submission is accepted.\n\nIf there are missing index values, then these values are stored in the following key_not_found variable.\nAll the missing index values are displayed in the following error message:\n10. The following two lines of code allow you to select the predictions across the index values that are common between the result file (labeled as 1) and the candidate’s submission file (labeled as 2).\n11. The required predictions for all the unique IDs in the result file and the candidate's submission are initialized in the actual_values (labeled as 1) and predicted_values (labeled as 2) variables, respectively.\nThen, the actual values and predicted values are passed in the gen_score function. This is shown in the following line of code:\n12. The gen_score returns the score and it is printed up to six decimal places.\n13. The program begins with the verify_submission function (labeled as 1). If an exception is raised based on the checkpoints provided in the verify_submission function, it is displayed to the candidate (labeled as 2). This is performed by using the following lines of code:\nYour tasks in the checker file\nOnce you have understood the structure of a checker file, you can easily create your own with reference to the sample checker file. These are some important points to remember which are as follows: \nEnter the correct formula to generate the score of candidates.\nEnter the correct name of the column ID in the ID variable of the verify_submission function.",

A checker file contains the following two functions: \n\n1.  **gen\\_score**: To generate the score after evaluation of the candidate’s submission.\n2.  **verify\\_submission:** To verify the file submitted by the candidate, you must perform some checks. Some of these checkpoints include checking the file type, number of rows present, number of columns present, predictions for all IDs provided in result.format, and so on.\n\n**Programming languages supported**\n\nHackerEarth uses Python 3 to create checker files.\n\n### Structure of a checker file\n\n#### Importing libraries\n\nYou must import all the required libraries. Refer to the following image for a list of the required libraries. \n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/HQBcaEJs6PZ-1rIkRIY2v95cNRzcWWkKzFc8Go0lAq3-QflcuWS-ZcfPlC-fLLS0U_lNTX52GUrFdY_qoWteqVZU3Yji1yVJvb_M0pc4DkfN1WaIFxELS1G-k2QzkMCk_2YZ_1INTz79bmp5pAcWRGs)\n\n#### Loading the result and submission file path\n\nThe parts of this code and its description are as follows:\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jbUOWdsGctlxZbchtpAL6z5KNxV9R9-EBM9flOPY9tGfCK5IieKezJqkocRxl4q0r_uGMiwBxMSKcbRbPhUG7TVCaCmui-o_HPyxLltvlD3dgONBraa-ZMMaG2Mlt5tPGRJ6YY_B866wjLWrBJUrLKw)\n\n1.  A default JSON file is loaded to the **data** variable from HackerEarth’s platform. This file contains the path of the test case and user submission.\n2.  The **testcase** variable is assigned the path for the test case file.\n3.  The **user\\_submission** variable is assigned the path of the candidate’s submission file.\n\n#### The gen\\_score() function\n\nThis function takes two arguments ― actual and predicted. The **actual** parameter represents the truth values of the target column(s) in the test case and the **predicted** parameter represents the predictions of the target column(s) in a candidate's submission file. Here, the score variable contains the formula based on the evaluation metric. \n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/cyTKFV9D7p2E9H6QGcuSXlLf2xiVPB0MWSdqZddhkFm8pNZyOXNh-BBht4hKncEGvBMtOT5vL9P79aUPKoZHCFT-6kJLjI_LubNOvUPffPpOFmxcLonrZBxrl0iM4BlYX1iEJORswERsdhLrMDGATD8)\n\nHere, the descriptions of the labels are as follows:\n\n1.  The gen\\_score function with two parameters as mentioned.\n2.  The score is calculated based on an evaluation metric and is assigned to the score variable.\n3.  The function returns the value of the score after the required calculation in the previous step.\n\n#### Example \n\nThe evaluation metrics are mostly imported from the scikit-learn library. The example is as follows;\n\n**![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cXoFpAbe1YGwP2deOkBeff5t5eDJ96g6cda5Y1HWTdbhR-Dw8TYg3cFWKZzk3TqaoMn3HUmTqkC4DL-xSz9NCtjTPu1uUuyqbcVaDus5MdeGiyu61MMAzqQMb8hEXBD8cqGkkLJPAoUvCODLuFx9pUg)**\n\nAs mean\\_squared\\_error is an error-defining metric, the lower the error the better the model is.\n\nWe always assume the highest score to be 100 so we subtract the error from 100. The max function is used to normalize the score to range between 0 to 100.\n\n**The verify\\_submission() function**\n\n1\\. The **ID** variable represents the name of the index or ID column. You are required to enter the name of the index or ID column in place of None.\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Fk8Nmdo-5_EMTLlM1mZVkJL18yXl7yxqKW3B1i0YLfF3-1U9ABHlDBupB3h5_XEi01KxprhFn6Pu8s5bfwTdb2rwc5yIAE25mgqWX7OF7mKfThh-pN3d2ZzDgKItgqMeuA-0W1swzhzFaR36fWrpBlk)\n\n**Example**\n\n**![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Oy8iy6spEbCrnDTwj9GNB4FwCk9hsCK3aaHQL1eWXbwSdfny1A80WtgfdJltu6sYw_UzQxYSF2XWneZPh5d2zdI-nDhIsDf-OU2cTnLYjSmlUCfYELEic1PtEIh-I0hb4bCw8Fxuh92e38yht6Wwspo)**\n\n2\\. The following line of code checks the type of the submission file submitted by the candidate such as whether it is in .csv format: \n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/tzWf1Hzo5UEthTxa6voXM_yXNpaVdTbioh9C_uNhuLcqW8-iy5OwYZOwhRk08be8g9N2eMAbEW-Kkn-reCRII6-OBs3qhOstaMonBdh1cuMg5TO79iJD6SueISzRYlMxrZeBot_A-CCahNma90g9kj8)\n\nIf the file is not in .csv format, then the checker raises an exception and displays the following error message:\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/OvkeELCc7gRjFh29ltM4qHm5AHpiAywdQZ0fNc14ny7Q557ssPHsGGimdfxGa5g9ZKT6VMgHrl4aeNLoVMCgOMBekfzNf-EDiw64p8wn8H6mjdH2FNxi3C-Ewju1LsxOIpZxPALE-xRGZQTSbcrADx4)\n\n3\\.

You are required to determine all unique IDs that are available in the result file and the candidate's submission. All the common index values or unique IDs are stored in this variable.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/UIllhYkhRJBvDZlCtEv55w-WMrgFp0vRd4M9V8FBz2Jjqf7gOKuc39j6sSyhulPc2NPwWDDvzCG7deKL3aoIy9PmTXGuG3qD2pXpdTrBBfPstXMMlyhB5gUHhe9ucSon2WSPNSzg-qKlnF-7azeNOBQ)\n\n9\\. A candidate can miss certain index values or unique IDs. You are required to check the unique IDs that are available in test cases but are not available in the candidate's submission. This is performed by using the following code of line:  \n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/LujshlRlxlyz3fUsFammMqHRUMCybLEtAfb0U5pmXyfz3R38ShFrae1-ystFJvPuBTmk4rJpQgUhBvqFNUd55p26F-14boFiyBk4vtoUloL-Go1uuQ8z_JO36jU0aF8M4P2pgWmNkiNf9YgRzyysPeU)\n\nHere, the **not\\_in\\_test** variable stores the indexes that are missing in the candidate’s submission file.  \nFurther, if the length of **not\\_in\\_test** is equal to 0, that is, there are no missing index values, then the submission is accepted.\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZHNzOGzt3_CbpU_QfuIbsUEWNlrVW6YT7GYBovPLSTkxnm6MZiAShg_Q1LYBJ0CrZoCBtWQ8oVnbgwogi4ng5mhm-u4335XQ_eeh-qvf-0OE0UYeSezwEvf1D_tzcNIiKPPRJ-LYiA0T4EqLawyIF5A)  \nIf there are missing index values, then these values are stored in the following **key\\_not\\_found** variable.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/eY7usy6plkMVfwcaUTH745KBxxNc4s1tGUPmeL7Q8K7_az3FKt8j5pKq1trUGvYcXjfdnRLnmEKyXiur8TUODshKsSFV31Q9ecYUup7JuNiWKdhvFOrSZ_f1CIrNLXyU0la_jJAosP6eYLdOP0WF5hQ)\n\nAll the missing index values are displayed in the following error message:\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/8dCT0NGZYbuoqNUhaG17Tpxxj0eKt9PrbinN-bLN81Lo7_X0gOSLNxKCy9cvTpjydK0R_IbIsfuj70C18oZfsBbrvEpzMM68CCufqOVtFvW7ovzBKIgaIBVPjDf-diT7pZnDSAO2t7L0G7a0Yz0rkjI)\n\n10\\.

In such cases, each of their submissions is auto-evaluated against the added test cases. \n*   The best submission amongst them is then considered for scoring the candidate.\n\n### **Format of scoring**\n\nThe format to score a submission based on a test case is as follows: **\"TESTRESULT\" <testcase\\_name> <score>**\n\n**Explanation**\n\n*   To score a test case, the statement should start with \"TESTRESULT\"\n*   <testcase\\_name> is the name of the test case for which the result is being verified. Words in a test case name should be separated by an underscore.\n*   <score> is the score where a positive integer value results in a successful test case. For example, there are 5 test cases out of which 4 are successful, in this case, the user will get 80% of the total marks allocated for the question.\n\nFor example, in this case, the validation script checks if the docker web app is running at specific endpoints and scoring accordingly. Refer to the given image to understand the format of scoring.\n\n![7.png](https://help.hackerearth.com/hubfs/Knowledge%20Base%20Import/7-4.png)  \n_NOTE_: You can access the sample scripts from within the question creation interface as well.",

The script makes a GET request to http://127.0.0.1:8001/test and stores the response in the output0 variable.\n2.  The script defines two variables: found with the value \"Hello From Node\" and notFound with the value \"404-Not Found\".\n3.  It checks if Node.js is installed by finding the location of the node executable and stores it in the outputnode variable. If outputnode is not empty, it provides the output \"TESTRESULT nodetest 10\"; otherwise, it provides the output \"TESTRESULT nodetest 0\".\n4.  It compares output0 with found to check if the GET request response matches the expected \"Hello From Node\" message. If the message matches, the script provides the output \"TESTRESULT GETtest 10\"; otherwise, it provides the output \"TESTRESULT GETtest 0\".\n5.  It makes a POST request to http://127.0.0.1:8001/test and stores the response in the output1 variable.\n6.  It compares output1 with notFound to check if the POST request response matches the expected \"404-Not Found\" message. If the message matches, the script provides the output \"TESTRESULT POSTtest 10\"; otherwise, it provides the output \"TESTRESULT POSTtest 0\".\n7.  It makes a GET request to http://127.0.0.1:8001/ and stores the response in the output2 variable.\n8.  It compares output2 with notFound to check if the GET request to the root endpoint response matches the expected \"404-Not Found\" message. If the message matches, it provides the output \"TESTRESULT GETtest2 10\"; otherwise, it provides the output \"TESTRESULT GETtest2 0\".\n9.  It makes a POST request to http://127.0.0.1:8001/ and stores the response in the output3 variable.\n10.  It compares output3 with notFound to check if the POST request to the root endpoint response matches the expected \"404-Not Found\" message. If they match, it outputs \"TESTRESULT POSTtest2 10\"; otherwise, it outputs \"TESTRESULT POSTtest2 0\".\n\n#### **Configuration script**\n\nThe command \n\nmkdir/home/ubuntu/code/NodeWebServer\n\ncreates a new directory named \"NodeWebServer\" within the \n\n/home/ubuntu/code \n\ndirectory path. \n\n#### **Solution**\n\n\\# install node,npm\n\n$ sudo apt-get update  \n$ sudo apt-get install nodejs -y  \n$ sudo apt-get install npm -y\n\n\\# creating a node project  \n$ mkdir solution  \n$ cd solution  \n$ npm i\n\n\\# installing http package\n\n$ npm i http\n\n\\# creating index.js with following content\n\n$ vim index.js\n\nconst http = require(\"http\");  \n// PORT  \nconst PORT = 8001;  \n// server create  \nconst server = http.createServer((req, res) => {  \n  if (req.url === \"/test\" && req.method === \"GET\") {  \n  res.write(\"Hello From Node\");  \n  res.end();  \n  }else {  \nres.write(\"404-Not Found\");  \n  res.end();  \n}  \n});  \n// server listen port  \nserver.listen(PORT);  \nconsole.log(\\`Server is running on PORT: ${PORT}\\`);\n\n\\# run the server\n\n$ node index.js",

AI evaluation\nAI evaluation uses Hackerearth's proprietary AI model to evaluate answers automatically. It will compare the base answer you provided to the candidate's submission. You can use the AI evaluation method to answer essay questions or questions with long text answers. \nYou also have the option to view the difference between the actual answer and the candidate's submission. For example, you are comparing the two answers after enabling View difference.\nYou can also provide a solution template for candidates, which can work as a starting point for them to write the answer.\nNote: Turn this feature on only for text-based answers and not for numerical answers or answers where the language is not English. You can use the Keyword evaluation method to evaluate such answers.\n2. Keyword evaluation\nSubjective questions can also be evaluated using the keywords method. A Keyword can be any of the following:\nText string: This can include spaces, special characters, and alphanumeric characters. It must have at least one non-whitespace character.\nNumber: This can include an integer or decimal.\nYou can use keyword evaluation to evaluate questions related to data analytics (MS Excel), mathematical numerical, or fill-in-the-blank questions.\nKeywords will be trimmed of leading and trailing whitespaces once an admin adds them. You can use Keywords with a maximum length of 30 characters. At least 1 Keyword is mandatory for the Keyword evaluation method. You can add more than one Keyword up to a maximum of 15 keywords. Each option mandatorily has a corresponding score. At least one keyword option score must be equal to the maximum score of the question.\nFor every keyword option, the subsequent condition needs to be fulfilled:\nOrganize Keyword Options in descending order based on their scores.\nVerify whether the keyword is present in the candidate's response at least once. This verification is case-insensitive.\nIf the keyword is found, allocate the associated keyword score as the question's score.\nIf the keyword is not found, the steps get repeated with the next highest-scoring keyword. \nExample: Text string as a keyword\nHere is an example where the added keyword is a text string. \nExample problem statement\nOnce the question is evaluated, and if the answer contains the exact keyword, the candidate will receive full marks assigned to that keyword.\nKeyword evaluation \nExample: Number as a keyword\nHere is an example where the added keyword is a number. \nIf the answer contains the exact keyword, the score assigned to the keyword is allocated to the candidate’s answer.\nNote: Partial matches will not be given a score.\nFor example, only the entire keyword will be the right answer to the given question.\nThe score will not be provided as the answer is 12, but the submission is 1. Similarly, with string answers, only the answer with the entire keyword will be the right submission. For example, if the expected keyword is mango, and the candidate gave the submission as man, the candidate will not receive any score.\n3. Manual evaluation\nSubjective questions can also be evaluated manually, which means you can give your own answer in the base answer, but it is not mandatory to write the base answer in this type of evaluation. You can manually check the candidate’s submission and use the base answer as a reference.\nThe base answer will also be present in the candidate’s report to make the comparison easy.\nThese three evaluation methods can be used to evaluate a subjective question.",

  "text": "Choosing quality questions\nThe key to a good test is the right number of quality questions with appropriate difficulty levels and enough time to answer these questions. While selecting questions, choose topics based on the candidates’ experience, especially for advanced topics such as Java project and Diagram-based questions.\nImportant: The examples in this section are based on the requirements described in \nBest practices: Getting the basic details right.\nMatching the questions to the requirements\nThis section is about adding the right questions for specific profiles.\nAnalyzing the job description\nDivide the requirements into the following three sections:\nSection 1: Requirements that the candidate must have to qualify for the position. In this case, the candidate must have strong Java skills.\nSection 2: Set of requirements for which basic knowledge is enough. In this case, the candidate should know how to create diagrams to explain the architecture\nSection 3: Good-to-have requirements. In this case, knowledge about Spring and Hibernate will be considered.\nSelecting questions for the primary skill\nScan through the various question types available in the HackerEarth library to find a programming question to test that skill. In this case, Java. We recommend that you select a Java Project question, which will allow you to assess the candidate’s Java skills.\nThe secondary skill requirement is creating diagrams and implementing the design. Add a diagram-based question to support that.\nYou have covered the primary skills. Let’s move on to secondary skills.\nSelecting questions for the secondary skills\nSelect MCQs to assess secondary skills.

  "markdown": "# Choosing quality questions\n\nThe key to a good test is the right number of quality questions with appropriate difficulty levels and enough time to answer these questions. While selecting questions, choose topics based on the candidates’ experience, especially for advanced topics such as Java project and Diagram-based questions.\n\n_Important_: The examples in this section are based on the requirements described in   \n[Best practices: Getting the basic details right](https://help.hackerearth.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003418893-getting-the-basic-details-right).\n\n**Matching the questions to the requirements**\n\nThis section is about adding the right questions for specific profiles.\n\n### **Analyzing the job description**\n\nDivide the requirements into the following three sections:\n\n*   _Section 1_: Requirements that the candidate must have to qualify for the position. In this case, the candidate must have strong Java skills.\n*   _Section 2_: Set of requirements for which basic knowledge is enough. In this case, the candidate should know how to create diagrams to explain the architecture\n*   _Section 3_: Good-to-have requirements. In this case, knowledge about Spring and Hibernate will be considered.\n\n### **Selecting questions for the primary skill**\n\nScan through the various question types available in the HackerEarth library to find a programming question to test that skill. In this case, Java. We recommend that you select a Java Project question, which will allow you to assess the candidate’s Java skills.\n\nThe secondary skill requirement is creating diagrams and implementing the design. Add a diagram-based question to support that.\n\nYou have covered the primary skills. Let’s move on to secondary skills.\n\n### **Selecting questions for the secondary skills**\n\nSelect MCQs to assess secondary skills. The sample requirement mentions three skills:\n\n*   Spring\n*   Hibernate\n*   REST\n\nStart with creating three sections, one for each topic, and not more than 5 questions per topic. Sections help you understand how the candidate has fared in each of the sections that you have created.\n\n**Selecting the right number of coding questions**\n\nThe ideal duration of a good screening test is not more than 90 minutes.

Select the ID type from the mentioned options.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/MU1FvdY91b7svyEyjtTiOCAuAQHqfEo9nMuTg4EjtLDYijSIYBaGuFghNy0Fhr9tW-wFsVP9UKSl0YxSfKN56oGDdNGg8CuttFZlC2yuxm_dqktn8ffcHdcG1_3Y_quKA7aaYbMf_lp0pO1Qo8r0Geg)\n5.  Click **Upload file** to upload the selected ID.\n6.  Click **Verify ID**. The system will verify your uploaded ID.\n7.  You will be redirected to the Photo verification window. Click **Capture** to capture a picture of yours**.**\n8.  Click **Proceed to verification**. The system will start verifying your Photo and ID. After the successful verification, you can proceed to the assessment. \n\nIf your ID verification is unsuccessful, you can retry the process once. If it fails again, you can still proceed to the assessment. Your test admin will review the ID after the assessment. \n\nThis is how ID verification works in the HackerEarth Assessments.",

It doesn't go through rigorous checks. \nClick SUBMIT. \nNote\nOnce you have submitted your code, you cannot edit it. However, you can make new submissions. All the submissions will be judged.\nHackerEarth provides the feature of automatically submitting the answer.\nYou have answered an SQL question successfully.\nEvaluation\nYour code is evaluated automatically by a HackerEarth SQL service that we call SQL judge.\nEvaluating queries\nWhen you submit your query, we do the following:\nSetup a new database\nCreate tables\nLoad data specified in the test case\nExecute your query on the newly set up database and compare the result with expected output.\nIf the output matches the expected result, then it is an accepted submission (AC). If the output does not match the expected result, then it is a wrong answer (WA).\nDetermining whether the solution is correct\nEach problem will have the following:\nOne or more input files each of which is based on the specifications mentioned in the problem statement. Each input file has a corresponding output file.\nYour program is run on each input files. To be judged as a correct submission, the output that is generated by your queries must match the output in the corresponding output files. Therefore, ensure that your statements are in order\nNotes\nYour output files must match the output files of the problem statement irrespective of what point in the program execution the output is written.\nIt is recommended that you do not read all the input before starting the output. Instead, you can print each result as you are reading through the input.\nYour code will be judged as an incorrect submission if: \nYou start your query in a way other than what is mentioned in the problem statement. \nFor example, if your query starts with ‘Enter the number’ and it is not mentioned in the problem statement, then your script will be judged as an incorrect submission irrespective of what the rest of your queries do.\nYou use a method other than using the standard input and output streams\nFor example, if you use command line arguments, read from a file, open a dialog box, etc., your code will be judged as an incorrect submission.\nErrors\nTime Limit Exceeded (TLE)\nTotal execution time <= (time limit*number of input files)\nIn an online test, the judge allocates resources such as memory and so on for evaluating each submission. However, your submission cannot continue to run for an infinite amount of time, and therefore, the judge will stop your submission from running after a predefined (set by the recruiter) time. The TLE error will be displayed in the following cases:\nIf your SQL script contains “sleep” and your queries stops executing.\nYour code terminates outside the time limit that was indicated \nFor example, if the time limit of an SQL script is 2 seconds and your script terminate on 2.001 seconds, it means: \nYour script exceeded the time limit by 0.001 seconds\nThe judge stopped evaluating your code after 2 seconds\nIf your solution exceeds the amount of time that is allotted for the problem or test case, or your solution never finished running in the allotted time because it was stopped in between.

It will be displayed in the following cases:\nYour SQL script contains a bug\nYou are not interpreting the problem statement correctly\nYour code matches the input test cases but does not match the output test cases\nRuntime Error (RE)\nThis error will be displayed when your program compiled successfully but exited with an error or crashed. It indicates that your query has failed to execute. You can avoid this error by ensuring that:\nYour queries are syntactically correct\nYour script is not violating any of the problem constraints\nConstraints Violation (CV)\nThis error will be displayed when one of the problem constraints is violated. The most common reasons for this error are as follows: \nYou have created too many tables\nYou have inserted too many rows inside a table\nThe constraints include the following:\nMaximum tables per database will be restricted constrained and you can only create tables up to the number that is specified in the problem\nMaximum rows per table will be restricted constrained and you can only insert rows up to the number that is specified in the problem.\nYour queries collectively have a hard time limit of 5 seconds.",

HackerEarth is always on a search for the finest of talent who can be part of our problem setting team to create and/or test problems along with writing good editorials in simple English for our contests and challenges. If you are remotely interested in doing these things, read the guidelines and apply to join this cool place full of talent, experience, and lots of learning and be part of our problem-setting hacksters. \nContest type and schedules\nThere are three types of contests HackerEarth hosts which are the following:\nEasy\nData Structures and Algorithms\nCircuits\n1. Easy\nEasy is a series of HackerEarth’s beginner-level challenges that are hosted on the first weekend of every month. The purpose of this challenge is to help beginners hone their coding skills in the language of their choice. Easy is a rated contest and is open for everyone to participate. You have 6 algorithmic questions to solve within 3 hours on a particular date and time. The leaderboard is generated based on the score given for each problem. The prizes and t-shirts are given to the top participants with ratings < 1600 (Beginners). \nThese are the following terms and conditions you need to know:\nIn order to be able to claim your prizes, your HackerEarth profile must be more than 60% complete.\nRatings will be updated 5 days after the challenge ends in each programmer’s user profile.\nIf your code is found plagiarised, you will not be eligible to claim the prize. \n2. Data Structures and Algorithms\nTechnical interviews with long coding rounds are a bit intimidating for freshers and even experienced people. Well, worry not because HackerEarth presents to you a one-of-a-kind Data Structures and Algorithms coding challenge where you can compete in a real-time interview environment and practice your coding skills to make them all the more efficient. The challenge has 3 programming questions and you have 90 minutes to solve all the questions. This is a rated contest but there are no prizes for this challenge. \n3. Circuits\nCircuits is a coding marathon to challenge programmers and developers with several programming questions of mixed difficulty levels over 9 days. The questions are created by multiple problem setters from HackerEarth and test your logical minds and coding skills by solving real-life programming problems. Circuits take place during the third and fourth week of every month. The timeline is as follows:\nDay - 0\n\t\nProblem 1, Problem 2, Problem 3 (Approximate)\n\t\nDay - 1\n\t\nProblem 4, Problem 5\n\t\nDay - 4\n\t\nProblem 6, Problem 7\n\t\nDay - 6\n\t\nProblem 8\n\t\nDay - 9\n\t\nChallenge ends\n\t\nNew problem statements will be published every 48 hours and the ace coders will win amazing prizes. The top 5 candidates will be given amazing HackerEarth T-shirts. \nProblem difficulty level\nThe problems are classified into the following 3 levels on the basis of difficulty:\nEasy \nMedium\nHard\nEasy\nEasy problems are basic problems that use the coding concepts directly without much mathematical calculation or problem-solving. They have easy constraints and a simple problem statement that can be understood by beginners easily. The test cases are also easy to pass and it is easier to implement the concept in the coding.\nMedium\nMedium problems are having moderate difficulty which includes the use of advanced coding concepts along with mathematical formulas and complex problem-solving. They have difficult constraints to implement and a bit complex problem statement. You need to solve the question by putting together various advanced coding concepts and implementing them in your code.\nHard\nThis is considered the highest difficulty level for a problem. These questions can be solved by applying various advanced coding concepts to a single problem. Sometimes they are real-life problems and though the problem statement is simple but implementing the solution is a bit difficult in these problems. The constraints are also difficult and these questions take time to solve. \nProblem setting guidelines\nQuestion statement\nProblem statement structure\nThe problem statement must be written in American English. It is divided into the following two sections:\nProblem statement\nTask\nFollow these guidelines to ensure the content of the problem statement is readable and understandable.\nProblem statement content\nAvoid using elaborate stories that can confuse the reader while reading the problem statement.\nMake the content gender-neutral. Do not use he or she.\nAvoid using vague or ambiguous sentences.\nEnsure that terms are consistent- If you are referring to ‘x’ as the distance between point A and point B, you must not refer to ‘x’ as ‘length’ anywhere else in the problem statement.\nAvoid spelling errors.\nEvery variable provided in the problem statement must be in Italics (except mathematical equations). For more information, refer to LaTex symbols.\nNeutral content\nAvoid using geography-specific backstory, names, places, or events that may not be familiar to a candidate.\nAvoid referring to any culturally specific territories. \nStrictly avoid any sexist, racist, or religiously offensive remarks or any sentence that promotes any type of political ideology, regionalism, or community-based generalization.\nAvoid references to politics, religion, and other controversial topics.\nImportant: If your problem statement contains anything mentioned in this section, it will be rejected without further checks.\nCurrency reference\nIf the question is currency-related, then it is advisable to use only US dollars.\nReference about any person\nStrictly avoid defaming any person, team, place, community, region, country, or sport. \nAvoid using references that represent hatred or personal bias against anything or anybody.\nIf you must refer to a person or use names in a problem statement, use only the following names:\nFirst name\n\t\nLast name\n\t\nGender\n\t\nAlice\n\t\nSmith\n\t\nFemale\n\t\nBob\n\t\nJones\n\t\nMale\n\t\nBen\n\t\nJohnson\n\t\nMale\n\t\nMike\n\t\nWhite\n\t\nMale\n\t\nTara\n\t\nGreen\n\t\nFemale\n\t\nAnita\n\t\nWilliams\n\t\nFemale\n\t\nLisa\n\t\nDavis\n\t\nFemale\n\t\nMary\n\t\nBrown\n\t\nFemale\n\t\nJohn\n\t\nWilson\n\t\nMale\n\t\nPaul\n\t\nMiller\n\t\nMale\n\t\nExample\nThe structure of the example is as follows:\nAssumptions: It comprises all the assumptions and variables of the example in bulleted points.\nApproach: It comprises a structural approach to the problem with the help of an example.\nImportant: The example provided here must be different from the sample test case.\nFunction description\nThis defines the number of parameters the function takes along with what they represent according to the problem statement. It also defines the answer which will be returned by the function.\nInput format\nThe structure of the heading is as follows:\nIt must be in bold.\nIt must be in sentence case only.\nIt must not be underlined.\nThere must not be a colon (:) after the heading.\nThe sample input format for a programming question is as follows:\nThe first line contains a single integer N denoting the size of array A.\nThe next line contains N space-separated integers denoting the elements of array A.\nIn this, the different inputs that are required are clearly specified in bullet points. \nIf your input format refers to test cases in the programming question, then follow this style of writing\nThe first line contains a single integer T, which denotes the number of test cases. T also specifies the number of times you have to run the solve function on a different set of inputs.\nFor each test case:\nThe first line contains a single integer N denoting the size of array A.\nThe next line contains N space-separated integers denoting the elements of the array.\nThis section is especially important when a candidate wants to use their own custom input while solving a problem. \nOutput format\nThe structure of the heading is as follows:\nIt must be in bold.\nIt must be in sentence case only.\nIt must not be underlined.\nThere must not be a colon (:) after the heading.\nThis section must contain precise and clear instructions about how the output is expected. For example, if the expected output of a programming question is a single numerical value that represents the length of an array, then you must write it in the following way:\n‘The output must contain a single integer value that represents the length of the array A.’\nNote: Sometimes, certain expected outputs are required to be printed in a new line or in a space-separated format. In such cases, it is important that such requirements are clearly called out.\nConstraints\nThe structure of the heading is as follows:\nIt must be in bold.\nIt must be in sentence case only.\nIt must not be underlined.\nThere must not be a colon (:) after the heading.\nThe constraints must be in Latex.\nEvery programming question requires some constraints. They represent the upper and lower limit of the input data. \nThe constraints must be formatted using the LaTex symbols. You can click the symbol provided in the menu of the Question statement text area. \nFor more information, refer to LaTex symbols.\nNote \nThe constraint’s range must be in exponential form. For example, if you want to use 100000, then the correct method to represent this is 10^5.\nThe same rule holds if you are using the mod value in a programming question, then it must be represented as 10^9+7 instead of 1000000007. This improves the readability of constraints.\nYou can check the sample format here. Here is an example of a sample problem.\nConflict resolution\nIf a problem tester finds any faults with a problem, the problem setter will have to correct the problem until the tester rechecks and approves the problem.\nIf a problem is found to be faulty while it is being used, the problem setter and problem tester will have to forfeit the entire compensation amount paid for the problem.",

  "text": "Improving your chances of being shortlisted for your dream job\nLike everything in life, being shortlisted also is a two-way street. It is our effort + your effort.\nHow we contribute to getting you shortlisted (our effort)\nSo, when we create a short list, we do the following:\nMatch the candidate to the selection criteria that the hiring company gives us\nInclude as many candidates who are the right fit\n\nMatches selection criteria + has done exceptionally well in the test = Right fit \nHow you can contribute to getting yourself shortlisted (your effort)\nRead the challenge details. Then, read them again.\nWhen we create a challenge we collect all the necessary information from the company to ensure that your experience of the hiring experience is smooth and transparent.\nWhat you should do\nRead the specifications of the challenge\nRead it multiple times. If you have queries, send us an email at support@hackerearth.com.\n\nUnderstand whether the challenge is meant for you or not\nCompanies may have specific conditions that a candidate must meet to get shortlisted. For example, a company may want to hire only from a specific college or hire a candidate with experience in coding in Scala or R only. If you do choose to participate in a challenge irrespective of the conditions, you will not be shortlisted even if you do relatively well in the hiring challenge. We make such conditions clear in the About Challenge section and we request you to read and understand this information before you begin the challenge. If you have any questions about this, please write to us at support@hackerearth.com.\n\nRead about the company\nOpen the company’s website. Read what the company does, what they have done in the past, where they are located etc. This information is usually available through the About link (though the name of the link may vary from company-to-company). \nDouble check if the number of years of experience is specified \nFACT: 60%—yes, you read that right—of our participants are rejected because they do not have the number of years of experience that the hiring company is looking for.\nFAQ 1: The requirement is for a candidate with 3 years of experience. I have 1.5 years of experience. Can I apply?\nThe short answer is NO. \nThe long answer is that if the challenge details specify that the company is looking for candidates with 3 years of experience and you have 1 year of experience, you will not be shortlisted.\nWhen companies specify a specific number of years of experience, apart from good coding skills they are also looking at the learning that a person gains by working for 3 years. \nFAQ 2: The requirement is for a candidate with 0-3 years of experience. I am an undergraduate student. Can I apply? \nAs an undergraduate, you can participate in this challenge, however, it will only be for learning. If a hiring company specifies the number of years of experience as 0-3 years, it means that while they are looking for freshers, those freshers should be able to join full-time and immediately. \nYou will not be shortlisted since you will not be able to join the company full-time. \nWhat you should not do\nDo not specify an incorrect number of years of experience. This is equal to lying and reflects on your professionalism and ethics. You will definitely be rejected by the hiring company. \nIt hurts your reputation because chances are the hiring personnel may remember you when you really do have that kind of experience and that will have an impact on your chances of getting hired then. \nWhat you should do\nYou could participate in our various campus/internship-related hiring challenges that are designed especially for you.\nApply for that job already! \nA lot of participants forget to apply for the job while filling up the registration and participation forms! Please apply for the job when you are registering. \nAnyone who hasn’t applied for the job, even by mistake, is not shortlisted. Period. \nPlagiarism is not cool. Period.\nDon’t cheat! We are sad that we have to add this to our post. We do not like cheaters and it's definitely not cool.\nWhile we encourage your friends and you to take up the test together, we definitely do not like it if you copy each other’s code. We have a dedicated team of people who check each and every code submission. This team also keeps records of plagiarism, so if you cheat, we have it on record. \nA lot of times, companies ask us to share the list of participants who have cheated and this will definitely hurt your chances of being shortlisted and hired. Once this list is shared, you will be flagged in their database. This could hurt your chances of being shortlisted.\nPerform well\nWhile evaluating the result sheet of a hiring challenge, we notice: great performers, good performers, candidates who barely even tried. \nIf you like a job/company, the company’s test should be motivation enough for you to reach your goal. \nThis mainly applies to task-based questions, where you are required to build an application. These questions are specifically tailored to the client's requirements. Solving such questions will give the hiring company an in-depth insight into your skills. \nJob hopping \nWhile it is great to know your value and worth in the market, it is inarguably cruel to waste a recruiter’s time by going through the entire process just to get an offer letter that can then help you get better offers in the market. \nWe track candidates who are serial job hoppers and the hiring company is made aware of this when we share the shortlisted profiles.\nHaving said that, if you are genuine a job seeker, we are happy to help you in every possible way. \nComplete your profile \nEver received a challenge invite that didn’t suit your skills at all? Not cool right? Would you like to avoid it in the future? Simple! Just make sure that your HE profile is complete and updated at all times.\nWe try our best to send out relevant emails to our community but we have noticed that due to incomplete profiles, sometimes, a few emails reach the wrong people.\nAlso, your HE profile link is one of the things that is shared with recruiters It is imperative that you keep it updated because it helps your chances of getting shortlisted. Some of the things that you could update are:\nResume\nJob changes\nNew skills\nOther projects\nWe have tried our best to cover most things that can improve your chances of getting shortlisted. We love hearing from our community so keep sharing your feedback and experience with us on support@hackerearth.com.\nAdditionally, if you get hired through one of our challenges, just post it all over social media and send us a screenshot and you will have cool HackerEarth merchandise waiting for you.\nHappy job hunting!",

Solving such questions will give the hiring company an in-depth insight into your skills. \n\n### **Job hopping** \n\n**While it is great to know your value and worth in the market, it is inarguably cruel to waste a recruiter’s time by going through the entire process just to get an offer letter that can then help you get better offers in the market.**  \n\n**We track candidates who are serial job hoppers and the hiring company is made aware of this when we share the shortlisted profiles.  \nHaving said that, if you are genuine a job seeker, we are happy to help you in every possible way.** \n\n### **Complete your profile** \n\nEver received a challenge invite that didn’t suit your skills at all? Not cool right? Would you like to avoid it in the future? Simple! Just make sure that your HE profile is complete and updated at all times.\n\nWe try our best to send out relevant emails to our community but we have noticed that due to incomplete profiles, sometimes, a few emails reach the wrong people.\n\nAlso, your HE profile link is one of the things that is shared with recruiters It is imperative that you keep it updated because it helps your chances of getting shortlisted. Some of the things that you could update are:\n\n*   Resume\n*   Job changes\n*   New skills\n*   Other projects\n\nWe have tried our best to cover most things that can improve your chances of getting shortlisted. We love hearing from our community so keep sharing your feedback and experience with us on support@hackerearth.com.\n\nAdditionally, if you get hired through one of our challenges, just post it all over social media and send us a screenshot and you will have cool HackerEarth merchandise waiting for you.\n\nHappy job hunting!",
